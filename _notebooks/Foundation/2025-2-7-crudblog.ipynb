    "My individual feature allows users to manage their bios within their profiles seamlessly. Users can personalize their profiles by adding or editing their bios, ensuring their information remains relevant and up-to-date. They also have the flexibility to remove outdated bios if needed. This feature enhances user engagement by enabling members to share meaningful details about themselves, allowing for better connections and interactions within the platform.\n",

    "### Handling List Requests in Flask Using the Bio Class\n",
    "\n",
    "In my Flask project, I used the Bio class to manage user profile data. This class represents database records where each row corresponds to a user profile, and columns store user details such as uid, name, password, and bio.\n",
    "\n",
    "I worked with lists when handling multiple database rows and dictionaries to structure individual user data for API responses. Using SQLAlchemy, a third-party library, I queried the database and formatted the retrieved data in JSON to be sent to the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List and Dictionary Representation in the Bio Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bio class stores data in a relational format, where each row in the table corresponds to a user profile. Here’s how it’s structured:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bio(db.Model):\n",
    "    __tablename__ = 'bio'  # Change the table name to 'bio'\n",
    "\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    uid = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)\n",
    "    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)\n",
    "    password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)\n",
    "    bio = db.Column(db.String(500), nullable=True)\n",
    "    profile_picture = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=True)       \n",
    "    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return f'<Bio {self.name}>'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists in Bio Class:**\n",
    "- When retrieving all user profiles, I use `Bio.query.all()`, which returns a list of Bio objects.\n",
    "- Each object in the list represents a row in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries in Bio Class:**\n",
    "- Each Bio object is converted into a dictionary so it can be formatted as JSON for the API response.\n",
    "- The keys in the dictionary represent the database columns, and the values contain the user’s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Requests: Use of Lists, Dictionaries, and Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of your Flask application, you interact with a database where data is stored in tables (which you can think of as columns and rows). Here’s a breakdown of how your code works with lists and dictionaries when querying and returning data:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working with Lists (Rows) and Dictionaries (Columns) in the Database:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In your code, the Bio model represents the structure of the database table that stores user profile data. When querying the database, you retrieve rows, each representing a user profile. You then convert each row into a dictionary (representing the columns of the table).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the `get_profile()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/api/user/profile', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_profile():\n",
    "    uid = request.args.get('uid')\n",
    "    if not uid:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"UID is required.\"}), 400\n",
    "    # Retrieve the user's profile from the database\n",
    "    bio_entry = Bio.query.filter_by(uid=uid).first()\n",
    "    if not bio_entry:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"Profile not found.\"}), 404\n",
    "    profile_data = {\n",
    "        \"uid\": bio_entry.uid,\n",
    "        \"name\": bio_entry.name,\n",
    "        \"bio\": bio_entry.bio,\n",
    "        \"profilePicture\": bio_entry.profile_picture\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"profile\": profile_data}), 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filter_by()` retrieves the first matching row where the uid matches the request parameter.\n",
    "- Once the profile is retrieved, you create a dictionary of the relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, each dictionary key (such as \"uid\", \"name\", etc.) represents a column in the database, while the values correspond to the data from that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Response Data (JSON) from API into DOM\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve retrieved the data from the database and formatted it into a dictionary, the next step is converting that dictionary into a JSON response that can be returned to the user. Flask's `jsonify()` function makes this easy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return jsonify({\"profile\": profile_data}), 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the `profile_data` dictionary is automatically converted to a JSON object, with the `profile` key containing the user’s profile data. This JSON response can then be processed on the client side and rendered into the DOM as needed. This is especially useful for rendering user profiles dynamically in web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queries from the Database: Extracting Python List (Rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "My queries are provided by SQLAlchemy, a third-party library that works with your Flask application to interact with the database. In the case of your `get_profile()` function, you’re using the `filter_by()` method to extract a specific row based on the uid. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bio_entry = Bio.query.filter_by(uid=uid).first()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Bio.query.filter_by(uid=uid)` generates an SQL query that filters the Bio table by the uid column.\n",
    "- The `.first()` method returns the first result that matches the uid (or None if no match is found).\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRUD Operations for User Profile in Flask API\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll break down the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user profiles, specifically focusing on your Bio model and how these operations are implemented in your API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create: Adding a New Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The Create operation is responsible for adding new user profiles to the database. If a profile doesn’t exist for the given uid, a new profile is created. This is done in the `update_or_create_profile()` function where a POST request is made.\n",
    "```js\n",
    " bio_entry = Bio.query.filter_by(uid=uid).first()\n",
    "    if bio_entry:\n",
    "        # Update the existing profile\n",
    "        bio_entry.name = name\n",
    "        bio_entry.password = password\n",
    "        bio_entry.bio = bio\n",
    "        if profile_picture_filename:\n",
    "            bio_entry.profile_picture = profile_picture_filename\n",
    "        db.session.commit()\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"Profile updated successfully!\"}), 200\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Create a new user profile if not found (for POST request)\n",
    "        new_bio = Bio(uid=uid, name=name, password=password, bio=bio, profile_picture=profile_picture_filename)\n",
    "        db.session.add(new_bio)\n",
    "        db.session.commit()\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"Profile created successfully!\"}), 201\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the profile is not already present in the database, it is created by creating a new Bio object with the provided data (uid, name, password, bio, and the optional profile_picture). The new entry is added to the session and committed to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update: Modifying an Existing Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The Update operation is designed to modify existing profile data. In your case, this is done via a PUT request in the `update_or_create_profile()` function. If a profile already exists (as identified by the uid), the provided data (name, password, bio, and optional profile_picture) is used to update the existing profile in the database. After updating the profile attributes, the changes are committed to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read: Retrieving Profile Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Read operation fetches the profile information from the database. In your code, this is handled by the `get_profile()` function, which retrieves the user profile by uid.\n",
    "```js\n",
    "@app.route('/api/user/profile', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_profile():\n",
    "    uid = request.args.get('uid')\n",
    "    if not uid:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"UID is required.\"}), 400\n",
    "    # Retrieve the user's profile from the database\n",
    "    bio_entry = Bio.query.filter_by(uid=uid).first()\n",
    "    if not bio_entry:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"Profile not found.\"}), 404\n",
    "    profile_data = {\n",
    "        \"uid\": bio_entry.uid,\n",
    "        \"name\": bio_entry.name,\n",
    "        \"bio\": bio_entry.bio,\n",
    "        \"profilePicture\": bio_entry.profile_picture\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"profile\": profile_data}), 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, a GET request is made, and it looks up the Bio table for a profile with the given uid. If no such profile exists, a 404 response is returned. If the profile is found, the profile data is returned in the response in JSON format. This code extracts the profile data from the `bio_entry` object and formats it into a dictionary, which is then returned as a JSON response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delete: Removing a Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The Delete operation removes a profile from the database. The `delete_profile()` function performs this action:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "@app.route('/api/user/profile', methods=['DELETE'])\n",
    "def delete_profile():\n",
    "    uid = request.args.get('uid')\n",
    "    if not uid:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"UID is required.\"}), 400\n",
    "    # Retrieve the user's profile from the database\n",
    "    bio_entry = Bio.query.filter_by(uid=uid).first()\n",
    "    if not bio_entry:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"Profile not found.\"}), 404\n",
    "    # Delete the profile picture file from the server\n",
    "    if bio_entry.profile_picture:\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            profile_picture_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], bio_entry.uid, bio_entry.profile_picture)\n",
    "            if os.path.exists(profile_picture_path):\n",
    "                os.remove(profile_picture_path)\n",
    "        except Exception as e:\n",
    "            return jsonify({\"message\": f\"Error deleting profile picture: {str(e)}\"}), 500\n",
    "    # Delete the profile from the database\n",
    "    db.session.delete(bio_entry)\n",
    "    db.session.commit()\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"message\": \"Profile deleted successfully.\"}), 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "It checks if the profile exists by querying the Bio table using the uid. If the profile exists, it deletes the profile picture from the server and then deletes the profile record from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Code Request: Handling API Requests in Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll dive into the different algorithmic elements and design choices used to handle requests in your Flask API. We will cover the use of code blocks to handle different types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), how the API class functions, and how sequencing, selection, and iteration are implemented. Finally, we’ll discuss the request parameters, how data is passed in the body of requests, and how the response is formatted using `jsonify()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of Code Blocks to Handle a Request\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle a request in Flask, we define specific routes and associate them with handler functions that process the request and return a response. Each route corresponds to a method, such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to define a route for getting a profile, we use the following code block:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "@app.route('/api/user/profile', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_profile():\n",
    "    uid = request.args.get('uid')\n",
    "    if not uid:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"UID is required.\"}), 400\n",
    "    # Retrieve the user's profile from the database\n",
    "    bio_entry = Bio.query.filter_by(uid=uid).first()\n",
    "    if not bio_entry:\n",
    "        return jsonify({\"message\": \"Profile not found.\"}), 404\n",
    "    profile_data = {\n",
    "        \"uid\": bio_entry.uid,\n",
    "        \"name\": bio_entry.name,\n",
    "        \"bio\": bio_entry.bio,\n",
    "        \"profilePicture\": bio_entry.profile_picture\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return jsonify({\"profile\": profile_data}), 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the code block listens for a GET request at the endpoint `/api/user/profile`. When a request comes in, the function checks for the required uid parameter, queries the database for the profile, and returns the profile data in a structured JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Class for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, the `flask_restful` extension provides the Resource class, which helps to organize the handling of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Each method is mapped to a corresponding function inside a class that inherits from Resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's the API class you use to handle profile picture operations:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "@token_required()\n",
    "    def get(self):\n",
    "        current_user = g.current_user\n",
    "\n",
    "        if current_user.pfp:\n",
    "            base64_encode = pfp_base64_decode(current_user.uid, current_user.pfp)\n",
    "            if not base64_encode:\n",
    "                return {'message': 'An error occurred while reading the profile picture.'}, 500\n",
    "            return {'pfp': base64_encode}, 200\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return {'message': 'Profile picture is not set.'}, 404\n",
    "\n",
    "    @token_required()\n",
    "    def delete(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Deletes the user's profile picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This endpoint allows for the deletion of a user's profile picture. It is restricted to users with an 'Admin' role.\n",
    "        The user whose profile picture is to be deleted is identified by a 'uid' parameter in the request's query string.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The process involves several steps:\n",
    "        1. Verifying that the current user has 'Admin' privileges.\n",
    "        2. Ensuring the 'uid' parameter is provided in the request.\n",
    "        3. Locating the user in the database using the provided 'uid'.\n",
    "        4. Checking if the user has a profile picture set.\n",
    "        5. Attempting to delete the profile picture file from the server.\n",
    "        6. Removing the reference to the profile picture from the user's database record.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Returns:\n",
    "        - A JSON object with a message indicating the success or failure of the operation.\n",
    "        - HTTP status code 200 if the profile picture was deleted successfully.\n",
    "        - HTTP status code 401 if the current user is unauthorized.\n",
    "        - HTTP status code 400 if the 'uid' parameter is missing from the request.\n",
    "        - HTTP status code 404 if the user is not found or if the profile picture is not set.\n",
    "        - HTTP status code 500 if an error occurs during the file deletion process or while updating the database.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        current_user = g.current_user\n",
    "\n",

    "            \n",
    "            #  Remove the user's reference to the profile picture\n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                user.delete_pfp()  # Call the delete_pfp method to update the database\n",
    "                return {'message': 'Profile picture deleted successfully'}, 200\n",
    "            except Exception as e:\n",
    "                return {'message': f'An error occurred while deleting the profile picture database reference: {str(e)}'}, 500\n",
    "        else:\n",

    "\n",
    "    @token_required()\n",
    "    def put(self):\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example:\n",
    "- **GET** retrieves the profile picture in base64 format.\n",
    "- **DELETE** removes the profile picture for the specified user.\n",
    "- **PUT** updates the profile picture with a new image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods corresponds to a specific HTTP verb and performs different actions on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequencing, Selection, and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic inside these methods often involves sequencing (steps taken in a particular order), selection (conditional checks), and iteration (repeated actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the `put()` method for updating the profile picture, we have sequencing and selection:\n",
    "```js\n",
    " if 'pfp' not in request.json:\n",
    "            return {'message': 'Base64 image data required.'}, 400\n",
    "        base64_image = request.json['pfp']\n",
    "       \n",
    "        # Make an image file from the base64 data \n",
    "        filename = pfp_base64_upload(base64_image, current_user.uid)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Sequencing:** The steps to validate and upload the image happen in order, first checking the request body and then proceeding to decode and upload the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection:** If the `pfp` key is missing from the request, the method returns an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration:** There is no explicit iteration in this example, but iteration would typically occur if you were processing multiple images or handling multiple users in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters and Return Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters for these functions come from two main sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Request Body:** For POST and PUT requests, the body is typically in JSON format. In the `put()` method, for example, we expect the body to contain base64-encoded image data under the key `pfp`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "base64_image = request.json['pfp']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Parameters:** For GET and DELETE requests, parameters are often passed in the URL or query string. For example, in the `delete_profile()` function, the uid is passed as a query parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "uid = request.args.get('uid')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return Type:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The return type of these functions is always JSON, formatted using the `jsonify` function from Flask. Each response is wrapped in a dictionary, and the `jsonify` function ensures the response is properly formatted as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a successful GET request might return:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return jsonify({\"profile\": profile_data}), 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `profile_data` contains the user profile details. The HTTP status code (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad request) is also included in the response.\n",
    "\n",
