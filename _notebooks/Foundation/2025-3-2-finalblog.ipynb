    "## Profile Management Feature Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature enables users to manage their profiles seamlessly. Users can personalize their profiles by adding or editing their bios and uploading a profile picture. Additionally, they have the option to remove outdated bios, providing them with full control over their profile information. This functionality enhances user engagement, as members can share meaningful details about themselves.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5 Things I Did Over the 12 Weeks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Profile Work:\n",
    "- Developed a section for users to add and edit their bios, allowing them to express themselves freely.\n",
    "- Implemented an \"Upload Profile Picture\" feature, enabling users to upload a profile picture to the site.\n",
    "- Displayed the user's profile below, showing Name, UID, Bio, password, and profile picture.\n",
    "- Styled the profile section to match the rest of the site\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. CRUD:\n",
    "- Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the user's profile.\n",
    "  - **Create (POST):** The create operation is responsible for adding new profiles to the database. If the profile doesn't exist for the given uid, a new profile is created\n",
    "  ![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-25.png)\n",
    "  - **Read (GET):** The read operation fetches the profile information from the database. In your code, this is handled by the get_profile() function, which retrieves the user profile by uid.\n",
    "   ![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-26.png)\n",
    "  - **Update (PUT):** The update operation is desinged to modify exesting profile data by using a PUT request.\n",
    "  - **Delete:** The delete operation removes a profile from the database. The delete_profile() function performs this action:\n",
    " ![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-27.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Backup and Restore:\n",
    "- Added backup and restore functions to ensure profile data and images can be preserved and restored, preventing any potential data loss.\n",
    "- Was able to add profile's data to a new table via a Postman api and was able to back up data using db_backup.py\n",
    "- Could show tables in SQLite Viewer \n",
    "- Successfuly able to restore data added previously using db_restore.py and could table via SQLite viewer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Postman Work:\n",
    "- Utilized Postman for testing the API endpoints\n",
    "- In postman endpoints were run which stopped at breakpoint line in at VScode\n",
    "- Jsonify output in Post man screat after exectution \n",
    "- Output from API shown in the frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Video\n",
    "- CPT requirements fulfiled was disscussed by me\n",
    "- Feature demonstration \n",
    "- Fronted and backend code was disscussed for my respective feature\n",

    "## MCQ\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/mcq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to my mcq score I am not dissapointed however I am not impressed either. My main strengths are Collaboration, Program function and Purpose, Simulations, and Legal and ethical Concerse. Meanwhile my weakness which I must focus on and correct are variables and assignments, calling procedures devoloping algorithmic, and algorithmic efficiency. Over all with some extra practice focus ing CPT/FRQ language I will be able to have a drastic increase to my score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrections:\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 11:\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image.png)\n",
    "The mistake I made in this question is getting the code segments wrong. Correct answer is C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 25:\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-1.png)\n",
    "This is incorrect since the string can be shortened using byte pair encoding. Correct answer is B\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 31:\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-3.png)\n",
    "I thought program 1 moved correctly to the grey square and program 2 did not however they both move the grey square. Correct answer C\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 39:\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-4.png)\n",
    "I got this question wrong because I chosee the option that said open standards and protocols cannot be used to allow copyrighted materials to be shared freely. That is incorrect and the correct answer was A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 43:\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-5.png)\n",
    "When attempting the problem I thought it would not be done in a reasonable amount of time due to the high amount of steps but it is done in a reasonable amount of time since the umber of steps of the algorithm is a polynomial, so the algorithm runs in reasonable time. The corrrect answer is B\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 49:\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-6.png)\n",
    "I was unsure on how to do this problem correctly so I just guessed but the correct answer the problem was option A\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 52:\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-7.png)\n",
    "I got this problem wrong because I did not take 3 into consderationg enough. Corection is D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 55:\n",
    "![alt text](/Aarav_2025/navigation/image-8.png)\n",
    "I did not understand this question leading me to guess B. The correct answer was D.\n",

    "Question 56:\n",

    "- During the N@tM I had went around to take a look at people's project to gain more insight on new ideas. While other groups were demoing their project I made sure to fully pay attention and made sure to give a review or scan their QR code to complete the google form. For example I saw a group with traveling app to Paris, and I saw how useful it is when we are traveling. I also noticed a group called Pawnsy and they inroduced a chess analyzer. I gave a lot of groups feedbacks and I listend to them.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a very nice looking website, but the purpose is quite minimal - in terms of actually helping people with choosing or managing clubs - Nikhil\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea of this website is actually quite innovative, you can tell the execution went through well and the idea of clubs in a real world application itself works very well. - Armaghan Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UI design is great! One thing I think you can improve on is the admin features, making it so admin can only edit the actual crud functions. Overall great project- Tarun Rayavarapu\n",
