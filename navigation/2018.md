a. What you learned from this quiz
In this 2018 practice exam mcq I have learned the types of problems I will be tested on in the AP exam. 
Some of the topic I have learned from this quiz is cryptography and security, game logic, identifiying missing code, and figuring out unecessary lines of code. 


b. What type of questions do you feel you are weak on?
The type of questions that I personally felt were challenging and was weak on are the questions were it asks you which of the following replaces the code. One of these types questions which I got wrong is question 11 and question 26. Another type of question which is a weakness of mine, needing to be improved upon is making sure I have a more clear understanding of the procedure of code when ever it is given, for an example question 55.
