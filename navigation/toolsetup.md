Week 1:

The first image is my macbook during my first week of coding. This picture shows that my github and vscode is synced with no errors. This was also thanks to CSA kids who were able to help me along the way.

Week 2:
During out first week it was really diffuclt colding with html because I was new to it. When I would ask Mr.Brown he was unable to help me.
So I then asked my friends Arya and Shawn were able to help make new header pages like the about me page to get me started.

Week 3: 
I learned how to add images to my website. I added a gif of mario to my homepage and a couple of images to my about me page. I then wrote a paragraph going more in depth about my hobbies. I also started working my tool set up page this week as well. Another thing I did was experiment witha ll the different thems provided and eventually settled for the time machine theme because I thought it was the best looking theme.

Week 4:
This week I started adding games like snake and cookie clicker. In my personal snake game I made it so that each red square adds one square of length to your snake. I also made settings which allows you to controll the speed of the snake and the amount squares to eat going all the way up to 10. Inside the snake there is a 10% chance of a golden square to pop up which gives 3 squares of length instead of 1. The last touch up I made to the snake game is that you are able to pause the game and you can restart the game without refreshing the page. For cookie clicker it was a lot simpler. All I did was give a couple upgrades and sound effect whenever you click on the cookie.
