Aarav's Sprint 2 Personal Blog:

What I taught:

The lesson which I taught is 3.8 which is about itterations. During our lesson we went over the different types of loops such as Infinite loops, do/while loops, for loops, and while loops.

What I learned:

Lesson 3.1	Manipulating string data and basic print statements	

Lesson 3.2	Understanding variable scope and data types overview  

Lesson 3.3	Using expressions for calculations and arithmetic operations

Lesson 3.4	Advanced string manipulation and String methods and formatting	

Lesson 3.5	Boolean logic in programming and True/False evaluations	

Lesson 3.6	Using conditions to control flow and If statements and outcomes	

Lesson 3.7	Complex conditional structures and Chaining conditions	

Lesson 3.10	List indexing and slicing and Iterating through lists	

Summary:

 We learned how to simplify complex subjects and build back up to the intricate details. For example, we started with simpler popcorn hacks and progressively moved to more challenging homework hacks that combined all concepts.
Adjust our presentation styles to suit different learning preferences, using a mix of visuals, examples, and interactive activities to engage students effectively.
Respond to student questions in a clear and accessible manner, ensuring they understood the answers.
Prepare diligently for each lesson by practicing explanations and anticipating potential areas of confusion.

Challenges and how we dealt with them:

We encountered many challenges, particularly since much of our learning was self-directed. For example, some of our pull requests were initially rejected by Mr. Mort, and we once submitted code without testing it locally. Each of these setbacks helped us learn and improve our approach.
Effective time management. We created detailed schedules, dividing tasks among team members and setting clear timelines, which kept us on track.
Having a structured schedule helped us coordinate better, ensuring everyone understood their roles and responsibilities, leading to smoother collaboration.
