Overwatch is game I used to love being one my favorite video games ever. Now ever since Overwatch 2 has been released the game has constantly has lowered in quality every single update. First all let me start with the ranked system. The ranked system is trash because it does not tell how much elo you have increased or decreased because you need to win at least 5 or 15 losses/ties which is ridiclous as it is hard to tell if you will get a big increase in elo or decrease in elo. In the original game you would see how much elo you gain or lose per gain and could see how much more you need to rank up.
